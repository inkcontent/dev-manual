This is the INK for developers documentation generator.

## Note:
👉🏼 This documentation is a work-in-progress. Please do not use/follow the instructions as we're still working on implementation.

Usage
=====
Assuming that you already have Python 3 installed.
you'll need to install sphinx and sphinx_rtd_theme in order to generate the documentation

using pip3 you can install them using the following commands.

    pip3 install sphinx
    pip3 install sphinx_rtd_theme


Then, the documentation can be generated by running:

    make html

To clean a previously generated documentation use :

    make clean

### Publishing docs

Nodejs is not used anywhere for the generation of docs, but it is need to build for some housekeeping tasks. In other words, you don't need to do `npm i` but still need Nodejs installed on your computer to be able to publish.

Before pushing to `master`: Run `npm run build` command. And that's about it, the docs folder will be ready to push if no error was encountered.
