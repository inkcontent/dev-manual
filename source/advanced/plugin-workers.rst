Plugin Workers
==============

Each INK plugin runs on a separate worker using `Web Workers API <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API>`_. This helps the INK application avoid any collisions or issues by keeping each plugin execution environment separate.

The INK software allows plugins to run on either ``Standard Worker`` or ``Module Worker``. Module Workers provide the ability to use the JavaScript ``import`` statement to import other modules. This sets Strict Mode as the default. Finally, it allows for top level declarations without polluting the workerâ€™s global scope. 

To easily execute your plugin with Module Worker , use the ______ flag while creating your plugin project.

.. code::

  inkplugin create <your-plugin-name> --module-worker

If you choose this method, this action will create a ``module`` field with a `true` value under the ``inkplugin`` section in your ``package.json`` file. This indicates that your plugin will support ES6 modules and will be loaded in the Module Worker.
