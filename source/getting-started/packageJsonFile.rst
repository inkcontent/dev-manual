Package File
============

The ``package.json`` file is one of the most important files for your plugin project. This is because it contains important information about your plugin. For example, a typical INK plugin ``package.json`` file looks like this:

.. code:: json

  {
    "name": "plugin-project-name",
    "version": "1.1.0",
    "homepage": "https://plugin-website.com",
    "description": "Plugin Description",
    "main": "src/main.js",
    "author": "Plugin Author",
    "license": "ISC",
    "scripts": {
      "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },
    "inkplugin": {
      "id": "a07fb265-20lb-4ae5-9762-e3a6d58be13e",
      "title": "Plugin Title",
      "icon": "sample.png",
      "readme": "readme.md"
    },
    "engines": {
      "ink": "^2.0.0"
    }
  }

As you can see, the above ``package.json`` file uses many standard package JSON fields as well as some custom fields that are essential for INK plugins. To ensure the INK Editor presents your plugin perfectly, itâ€™s extremely important that you fill out all of the fields EXCEPT the ``id`` field (this action is prohibited).

.. warning::

  Modifying the ``id`` field in the ``inkplugin`` section of your ``package.json`` file is prohibited. This is because this field uniquely identifies your plugin and is used for operations like updating, activating, and deactivating the plugin.
