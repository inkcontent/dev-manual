INK APIs Intro
==============

The INK Editor provides some of its core functions for developers to use. This makes it possible for plugins to safely interact with the INK Editorâ€™s core. These functions are divided into namespaces according to their functionalities. All of these functions combine to form the INK APIs. 

INK APIs are available through ``inkapi.js`` for every plugin. This file is mandatory for plugin projects.

.. note::

    Each INK API function will return a promise with a resultant value (if applicable).
