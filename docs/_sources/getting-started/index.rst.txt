Introduction
============

INK software is used by tens of thousands of content creators to make their content get found, be more engaging and convert.

With plugins you can greatly extend and expand the functionality of the INK Editor. At launch, you are able to create export plugins. We are quickly expanding the power of the API to enable new types of plugins. You can find some demo plugins here_.

We designed our plugin architecture with developers in mind. You can make a fully functioning plugin in minutes, using vanilla JavaScript and our handy command line tools.
